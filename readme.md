# 2. Programming a Guessing Game

Following the [Rust Doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) I have here [main.rs](src/main.rs).

I did my own exercise using the things I learned here. You can find this program in [christmas_tree.rs](src/christmas_tree.rs). 

Ensure you have `rustc` and run with:
```
rustc src/christmas_tree.rs 
./christmas_tree
```

Example output:
```
$ ./christmas_tree 
What is the size of your christmas tree? 10
          *          
         ***
        *****
       *******
